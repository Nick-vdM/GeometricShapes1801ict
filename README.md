# Geometric Shapes #

This is a small project done for 1810ICT with the requirements in project3.pdf. In short, the screen.cpp file is used to display a variety of classes. Its main purpose is to exercise inheritance and polymorphism.

The proposed structure to solve it is as follows:

## Part 2.2 - My Template Painter ##
The basic classes and functions being made here are:
### Shapes and properties ###
#### Point ####
* x and y

#### Line ####
* Two points; source & target

#### Ellipse ####
* anchor point
* a = x-radius
* b = y-radius 
* if a = b: becomes circle

#### Polygon ####
* n number of sides
* length of each side #IS IT FOR EACH LENGTH?#
